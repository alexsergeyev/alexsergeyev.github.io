  summary: |
    As a seasoned Senior Technical Lead, I have a proven track record from driving IoT platform development at Netronix to delivering high-level technical consultancy at HiQ. At Netronix, I scaled the R&D team and built a robust IoT platform, showcasing my leadership and technical prowess. Transitioning to HiQ, I refined my expertise through comprehensive IT evaluations, risk assessments, and best practices in Technical Due Diligence (TDD). Now, as Technical Lead/PO Cloud Foundation at Postnord, I decentralize cloud architectures, drive a FinOps culture, streamline onboarding, and enforce robust security and compliance measures. Leveraging my broad programming expertise, deep understanding of SQL and NoSQL databases, and commitment to infrastructure automation, I empower development teams to drive innovation and achieve operational excellence.
